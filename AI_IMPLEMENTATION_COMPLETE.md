## üõ†Ô∏è How to Install

### Step 1: Routes Already Added ‚úÖ
The AI routes have been added to `routes/api.php`:
```php
Route::middleware(['web', 'auth'])->prefix('ai')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/insights', [AIInsightsController::class, 'getInsights']);
    Route::get('/recommendations/inventory', [AIInsightsController::class, 'getInventoryRecommendations']);
    Route::post('/ask', [AIInsightsController::class, 'askQuestion']);
    Route::get('/health-score', [AIInsightsController::class, 'getHealthScore']);
    Route::get('/daily-brief', [AIInsightsController::class, 'getDailyBrief']);
});
```

### Step 2: Clear Cache
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

### Step 3: Verify Routes
```bash
php artisan route:list --path=api/ai
```

You should see:
```
GET     api/ai/insights
GET     api/ai/recommendations/inventory
POST    api/ai/ask
GET     api/ai/health-score
GET     api/ai/daily-brief
```

### Step 4: Add to Dashboard (Optional)
Add this line to your owner dashboard blade file:
```blade
@include('components.ai-insights')
```

Or manually copy the HTML from `resources/views/components/ai-insights.blade.php`
