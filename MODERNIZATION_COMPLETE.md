composer static-analysis      # Run PHPStan analysis
composer test                 # Run test suite
composer test-coverage        # Generate coverage report

# Security monitoring
composer audit               # Check for security vulnerabilities
```

### 📋 GitHub Actions Features
- **Multi-matrix testing**: PHP 8.1-8.3 with prefer-lowest/prefer-stable
- **Quality gates**: All checks must pass before merge
