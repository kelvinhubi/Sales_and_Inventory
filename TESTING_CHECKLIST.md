# Post-Implementation Testing Checklist

## ✅ BEFORE YOU START TESTING

### 1. Clear All Caches
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

### 2. Verify Routes
```bash
php artisan route:list | findstr "owner"
php artisan route:list | findstr "manager"
```

Expected output should show:
- Owner routes with `role:owner` middleware
- Manager routes with `role:manager` middleware

---

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

### Test 1: Role-Based Access Control
- [ ] Login as Owner
- [ ] Access owner dashboard - Should work ✓
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Login as Manager
- [ ] Try to access owner dashboard - Should get 403 error ✓
- [ ] Access manager dashboard - Should work ✓

**Expected Result:** Managers CANNOT access owner pages, and vice versa

---

### Test 2: API Authentication
- [ ] Open browser in Incognito/Private mode
- [ ] Try to access: `http://localhost:8000/api/products`
- [ ] Should redirect to login or show unauthorized

**Expected Result:** All API endpoints require authentication

---

### Test 3: Rate Limiting
- [ ] Go to login page
- [ ] Enter WRONG password 6 times quickly
- [ ] After 5th attempt, should see "Too Many Attempts"
- [ ] Wait 1 minute
- [ ] Try again - Should work

**Expected Result:** Login blocked after 5 failed attempts

---

### Test 4: Security Headers
- [ ] Open any page in browser
- [ ] Open DevTools (F12)
- [ ] Go to Network tab
- [ ] Reload page
- [ ] Click on the main request
- [ ] Go to "Headers" section
- [ ] Check Response Headers

**Expected Headers:**
- [ ] X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [ ] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- [ ] Content-Security-Policy: (long value)
- [ ] Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

---

### Test 5: Session Security
- [ ] Open DevTools > Application > Cookies
- [ ] Note cookie value before login
- [ ] Login successfully
- [ ] Check cookie value after login
- [ ] Cookie value should be DIFFERENT

**Expected Result:** Session regenerates after login (different cookie value)

---

### Test 6: CORS Configuration
- [ ] Open DevTools > Console
- [ ] Try to make fetch request from different origin
- [ ] Should be blocked by CORS policy

**To test:**
```javascript
// Run in console:
fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/products')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log(d))
  .catch(e => console.log('CORS blocked:', e))
```

---

### Test 7: Existing Functionality
- [ ] Create a new order - Should work ✓
- [ ] View products - Should work ✓
- [ ] Update inventory - Should work ✓
- [ ] Generate reports - Should work ✓
- [ ] View analytics - Should work ✓
- [ ] Dashboard loads - Should work ✓

**Expected Result:** All existing features still work

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If you get "419 Page Expired":
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan session:table
php artisan migrate
```

### If you get "403 Forbidden" on legitimate access:
- Check user Role in database (should be 'Owner' or 'Manager')
- Clear browser cookies
- Logout and login again

### If you get "Too Many Requests" error:
- Wait 1 minute
- Or clear Redis/cache:
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
```

### If API routes don't work:
```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan serve
```

### If session issues occur:
- Check `config/session.php` changes were saved
- Run: `php artisan config:clear`
- Clear browser cookies
- Try different browser
