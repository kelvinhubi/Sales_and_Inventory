## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Critical Security Fixes (Phase 1):
1. ✅ **Role-Based Access Control** - Owners & Managers properly separated
2. ✅ **API Authentication** - All 15+ API endpoints now protected
3. ✅ **CORS Security** - Restricted to known domains only
4. ✅ **Rate Limiting** - Login attempts limited to 5/minute

### High Priority Fixes (Phase 2):
5. ✅ **Security Headers** - XSS, Clickjacking, MIME sniffing protection
6. ✅ **Session Security** - Encrypted, strict same-site policy
7. ✅ **Session Regeneration** - Prevents session fixation attacks

## 🧪 Testing Required

Before deploying, run through the `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`:

1. Test role-based access
2. Test API authentication
3. Test rate limiting
4. Check security headers
5. Verify session regeneration
6. Test existing functionality

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Now):
```bash
# Clear caches
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear

# Test locally
php artisan serve

# Run tests
php artisan test
```

### Before Production:
1. Update `.env` with production values
2. Set `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true`
3. Add production domain to CORS
4. Enable HTTPS
5. Run security scan

### Optional (Phase 3):
1. Input sanitization improvements
2. Remove sensitive logging
3. Add email verification
4. Implement 2FA for owners
5. Create role enum
