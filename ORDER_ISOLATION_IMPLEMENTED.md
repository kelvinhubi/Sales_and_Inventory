# Order Isolation Implementation

## Overview
Each user now has their own isolated order history. Users can only view, create, update, and delete their own orders.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `database/migrations/2025_10_17_000001_add_user_id_to_orders_table.php`
- Added `user_id` foreign key column to `orders` table
- Column is nullable to handle existing data
- Cascades on user deletion
- Migration applied successfully (Batch 2)

### 2. Order Model Update
**File:** `app/Models/Order.php`
- Added `user_id` to `$fillable` array
- Added `user()` relationship method: `belongsTo(User::class)`

### 3. OrderController Security Updates
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Api/OrderController.php`

All methods now enforce user isolation:

#### index() - List Orders
```php
->where('user_id', Auth::id())
```
Users only see their own orders in the list.

#### store() - Create Order
```php
'user_id' => Auth::id()
```
New orders automatically assigned to authenticated user.

#### show() - View Single Order
```php
->where('user_id', Auth::id())->firstOrFail()
```
Users can only view their own orders (404 if not owner).

#### update() - Update Order
```php
->where('id', $id)->where('user_id', Auth::id())->firstOrFail()
```
Users can only update their own orders (404 if not owner).

#### destroy() - Delete Order
```php
->where('user_id', Auth::id())->firstOrFail()
```
Users can only delete their own orders (404 if not owner).

#### finalSummary() - Dashboard Statistics
```php
->where('user_id', Auth::id())
```
Dashboard only shows authenticated user's order statistics.

### 4. Data Migration
**Script:** `assign_orders_to_users.php`
- Assigned existing orders (2 orders) to the default Owner user (ID: 4)
- All existing orders now have a user_id assigned

## Testing

### Verify Isolation
1. Login as User A
2. Create an order
3. Logout and login as User B
4. User B should NOT see User A's order
5. Create an order as User B
6. Logout and login as User A
7. User A should only see their own order, not User B's

### API Endpoints Secured
- `GET /api/orders` - Returns only current user's orders
- `POST /api/orders` - Creates order for current user
- `GET /api/orders/{id}` - Returns 404 if not owner
- `PUT /api/orders/{id}` - Returns 404 if not owner
- `DELETE /api/orders/{id}` - Returns 404 if not owner
- `GET /api/orders/final-summary` - Shows only current user's stats

## Security Benefits
✅ **Data Privacy:** Users cannot access other users' orders
✅ **Authorization:** All CRUD operations check ownership
✅ **Statistics Isolation:** Dashboard shows only user's own data
✅ **Automatic Assignment:** New orders auto-assigned to creator
✅ **Referential Integrity:** Cascade delete on user removal

## Frontend Impact
- No changes needed in `resources/views/owner/order.blade.php`
- All filtering handled at API/backend level
- Frontend continues to work as before

## Database Status
- Total orders: 2
- Orders with user_id: 2
- Orders without user_id: 0

✅ **All orders properly isolated**

## Future Considerations
1. Consider adding user isolation to `PastOrder` model as well
2. Add user_id to rejected_goods table if needed
3. Consider role-based access (Owners can see all, Managers see only their branch)
4. Add audit logging for order access attempts
